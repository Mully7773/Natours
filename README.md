## Description

I developed this website using Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and SASS course to improve my CSS skills and to better familiarize myself with SASS and the SCSS syntax. I employ all SASS and CSS best practices and utilize variables, mixins, partials, and more. I also optimized my build by compressing the CSS and configuring responsive images.

## Features

This page features an animated mobile menu with unique hover effects and slide-in text. Each section is marked by an animated heading and an angular design, which is thematically reflected in other areas of the page. Gradients were utilized over the top of images to portray color and personality. In addition, I used a background video in one section to give it more of a unique feature. I made custom radio buttons for the form to personalize it and better fit the overall theme. This website is also fully responsive and images were made responsive to increase overall performance on mobile devices.
